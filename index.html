    							<h3>About Me</h3>
    						</div>
    						<div class="half-width">
    							<p>I'm currently based in Tampa, FL. My journey into tech started with a desire to make a career change from the Accounting field to one that would not only challenge me to learn something completely different, but also allow for geographic flexibility. Tech seemed to be just what the doctor ordered. And so, it began.</p>
								<p>I have found many skills I already had were highly transferrable. Organizational, communication, and analytical skills are definitely useful in the front-end development field. Once I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the challenge and flexibility I was looking for in my work.</p>
								<p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible. I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices. You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and quickly & accurately convert it into a webpage that is pixel-perfect match.</p>
